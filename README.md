# Source of data
This repository contains a folder called data which contains a data set called religionByCountry.csv which I found on github while looking for public data sets. When I searched 'public data sets' in the search bar I found a repository by Curran Kelleher (curran) called 'data' which contained all sorts of public data sets. This one seemed most convenient to use for this assignment.

#Description of data
